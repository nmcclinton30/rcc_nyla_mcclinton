Hi! I’m Nyla McClinton, a behavioral neuroscience major at Dominican University in Illinois.

This website was built as a portfolio project to explore psychological traits using real-world data and data tools in R. I analyzed responses from a personality dataset focused on the Dark Triad traits — narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism — and visualized how these traits vary across gender.

This project showcases my skills in data organization and creating graphs in R using ggplot2, all published through Quarto.

Feel free to explore my visualizations and see how psychology and data analysis intersect.
